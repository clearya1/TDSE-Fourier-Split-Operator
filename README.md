Supervised by Dr. Lee O'Riordan.

## Overview 

Parallelised code to solve the time dependent Schroedinger equation, using the Fourier split-operator method. 

## Jupyter Notebook

For a run through of the theory behind the Fourier split-operator method, please refer to the jupyter notebook, 'TDSE Solver.ipynb'. 

## Contents of the Repository

The main code is found in the 'tdse.py' Python script. An analytic code for the time independent Schroedinger equation can be found in 'tiseAnalytic.py'. Some scaling analysis, which was done on Kay, the Irish supercomputer managed by ICHEC, can be found in the KayProfiling folder. Some numerical results can be found in the Testing Results folder.
